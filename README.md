# Computer-Design-Prototyping
Computer Design and Prototyping project where I designed a multicore 5 stage pipelined processor with L1 cache implementation. It is based on the MIPS instruction set architecture.


Processor designs currently completed and fully functioning :-

- [x] [![Endpoint coverage](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=progress)](#progress)  Single Cycle Processor Design
- [x] [![Endpoint coverage](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=progress)](#progress)  Pipelined Processor Design without Branch Prediction
- [x] [![Endpoint coverage](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=progress)](#progress)  Pipelined Processor Design with Branch Prediction
- [x] [![Endpoint coverage](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=progress)](#progress)  Pipelined Processor Design with Branch Prediction and an L1 instruction cache and data cache 
- [x] [![Endpoint coverage](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=progress)](#progress)  Multicore processor Design with each core being Pipelined along with Branch Prediction and an L1 instruction cache and data cache along with a memory bus controller that implements the MSI protocol
